# Button-Game
 
This is a simple button game where the goal is to click the button in order to get a high score. Each time the button is clicked, the chance that the next click will reset your score increases. Every 10 clicks will change the color of the button. 

How high can you score?



The game is built with HTML and CSS running the front end and UI, while Javascript handles the backend functionality.
